many small python programs for many little tasks

This repository is a collection of several small projects I have made to practice python and teach coding concepts, all code is functional but not designed to be used for a larger project because it is quite unoptimized and likely not secure or stable. Please use this code as you like and reccomend changes if you find any to make
