many small python programs for many little tasks

This repository is a collection of several small projects I have made to practice python and teach coding concepts, all code is functional but not designed to be used for a larger project because it is quite unoptimized and likely not secure or stable. Please use this code as you like and reccomend changes if you find any to make

List of Programs:
KinematicCalc.py - A calculator designed to take at least 3 values and return the other 2 for a kinematic equation, e.g. [a,delta x, v0; return vf, t]
Tic Tac Toe.py - A tic tac toe game designed to be played by 2 players on the same keyboard
